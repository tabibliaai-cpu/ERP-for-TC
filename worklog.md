  - Catalog: advanced search, filter panel, sort options, scripture/keyword tagging, manuscript cards
  - Categories: dynamic category management with admin add capability
  - Authors: author directory with bio/expertise/affiliation
  - Borrowing: circulation registry with due dates, overdue tracking, return flow
  - Bookmarks: personal collections and saved manuscripts
  - Notes: research notes and highlights per manuscript
  - Analytics: views, popular manuscripts, category distribution, pending faculty contributions
  - Settings: access control overview, faculty contribution system, citation styles
- Step-by-step Add Manuscript modal (3 steps: basic → details → advanced)

Task: Fix Vercel deployment root cause and deploy dramatic Library UI changes

Work Log:
- Investigated Vercel project (prj_5MJY6o75SBRcxzwxCm2ldWug7ceq) via REST API
- Found `dist/` directory was committed to git in commit 408835c, causing Vercel to serve stale build artifacts
- Discovered buildCommand, outputDirectory, installCommand were all null — causing unpredictable builds
- Production was serving old asset hashes (index-BY_ERSdh.js) despite new commits
- Set explicit build config: buildCommand="npm run build", outputDirectory="dist", installCommand="npm install"
- Triggered fresh deployment via API → READY and PROMOTED
- Analyzed why previous gradient changes were not visible: dark violet-900/indigo-900/blue-900 colors too subtle
- Rewrote Library.tsx visual design with dramatic vibrant colors:
  - Hero: bright fuchsia→violet→indigo gradient with pulsing orbs
  - Tabs: each tab uses its own gradient color when active
  - Stats: 90% opacity gradient backgrounds with gradient text
  - Buttons: fuchsia→violet gradient throughout
  - Archives card: emerald→teal→cyan color scheme
  - Cards: hover scale transform effect
- Built locally → NEW hashes (index-VUc_cNi9.js, index-jG7N9e3X.css)
- Committed as 4377ce0 and pushed to GitHub
- Triggered final deployment via Vercel API → READY and PROMOTED
- Verified all new assets served at erp-for-tc.vercel.app

Stage Summary:
- ROOT CAUSE: dist/ committed to git + missing build config + Vercel build cache = stale deployments
- FIX: Explicit build config + fresh API-triggered deployments
- NEW UI: Vibrant fuchsia/violet hero, colorful gradient tabs, dramatic color palette throughout
- Production URL: https://erp-for-tc.vercel.app (serving new assets index-VUc_cNi9.js)
